ABOUT

One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of a web application to the
keys on the keyboard. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, we will make
a virtual piano in this project.

Project has 5 stages:

    1. "Add markup" - First, you need to add some elements to the body of the HTML document and learn to work with tags responsible
    for user input from the keyboard. 
    2. "Page styling" - This stage is an opportunity to improve the appearance of your piano and make your application not only interesting but unique. 
    3. "Application functionality" - Learn how to create events that occur when a key is pressed on the keyboard. 
    4. "Let there be music" - Now, let's teach our musical instrument how to actually produce sound. 
    5. "Adding and styling new keys" - Finally, add the black keys to your piano and customize them. We're done! 


LEARNING OUTCOMES

You will learn how to write HTML documents and work with the most popular CSS properties. You will also learn how to use JavaScript
to make event handlers for browser events and create and insert new elements into documents.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Every single stage information can be found inside 'Coffee Machine' folder. Upon going inside the folder and selecting specific stage, 'task.html' 
provides information what is required/needed to be done to complete the stage. 'Task' folder, 'src' folder contains the final stage implementation 
including previous stages.
